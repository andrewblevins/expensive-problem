        <p>Bring your most expensive problem. Leave with clarity, energy, and a way forward.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 1. Let them self-identify -->
    <section>
        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>You're high-functioning, creative, and entrepreneurial. You think from left field. You live for transformation. You've had sudden breakthroughs before, and you know it can happen again. You believe it's possible to shift your perspective in a weekend.</p>
        <p>You are confident in your capacity to take action in your personal life or work. However, right now you're stuck. It's frustrating. Annoying. It drags at your attention. Sometimes it keeps you awake at night. You know that if you can move through it, life will feel different. You'll be free to act, to create, and to lead.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Define the concept -->
    <section>
        <h2>What's an expensive problem?</h2>
        <p>It's the kind of challenge that costs you dearly—not only in money, but in time, energy, and the way it weighs on your mind.</p>
        <p>You'll bring an expensive problem to a small group of peers. You may define the problem in terms of its financial cost, its personal cost in terms of time and energy, or both.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Make it concrete -->
    <div class="examples">
        <div class="examples-inner">
            <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You're at a crossroads between multiple career paths. Each could change your life, but the paths feel incommensurate.</li>
                <li>You've built a thriving project—a consultancy, say—but you're trapped in an hourly income model. You know that freeing your time from your income would allow you to do higher-impact work.</li>
                <li>You've built a company where the product is you. You'd like to exit while the company continues to thrive, but you're afraid that if you leave, the whole thing will collapse.</li>
                <li>As a founder, you've suffered a blow to your reputation. You need to find ways to rebuild trust quickly and with integrity.</li>
                <li>You want a life partner, but the path feels blocked by culture, timing, or something you can't quite name.</li>
                <li>You and your cofounder are close friends and strong partners. However, you have an internal conflict with them that feels significant and you can't find a way to talk with them about it.</li>
                <li>You have a fantastic idea but you don't know how to turn it into reality.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. The transformation -->
    <section>
        <h2>What you'll walk away with</h2>
        <p>On Sunday evening, you will have:</p>
        <ul class="outcomes">
            <li>The ability to see your problem from multiple perspectives—fluid uncertainty, adult developmental psychology, systematization and automation, metarationality.</li>
            <li>Framings of your situation that you could not have reached on your own.</li>
            <li>Clarity of direction and renewed energy.</li>
            <li>Concrete next steps and the confidence to take them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is not about abstract ideas. It's about dismantling what's keeping you stuck, and being inspired to take practical action on the other side.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Logistics -->
    <section>
        <h2>How the weekend works</h2>
        <p>The workshop consists of four sessions across two days, with a carefully selected group of no more than twenty participants.</p>
        <p>You engage in intensive group exploration, learn frameworks you can apply immediately, and work directly on your specific problem. The process is rigorous, creative, and sometimes surprising. Spacious breaks are built in so that insights land and conversations deepen.</p>
        <p>You will leave not only with clarity on your own problem, but with new ways of seeing that extend far beyond it.</p>
